## 🧠 How It Works

- Targets appear at random positions in a 600x400 game box.
- You have **1 second** to click the target before it disappears.
- Each click is counted as a **hit**; missing it counts as a **miss**.
- Stats update in real time.
- The game ends after **60 seconds**, showing your final score.
